This project is based on [StarResonanceDps](https://github.com/anying1073/StarResonanceDps), which implements the network packet capture technique originally developed by [StarResonanceDamageCounter](https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter). Many thanks to both authors for their contributions.

The tool does not require modifying the game client and does not violate the game's Terms of Service. It is intended to help players better understand combat data, avoid ineffective optimizations, and improve overall gameplay.
