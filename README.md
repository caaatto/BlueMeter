This project is based on [StarResonanceDps](https://github.com/anying1073/StarResonanceDps), which implements the network packet capture technique originally developed by [StarResonanceDamageCounter](https://github.com/dmlgzs/StarResonanceDamageCounter). Many thanks to both authors for their contributions.

The tool does not require modifying the game client and does not violate the game's Terms of Service. It is intended to help players better understand combat data, avoid ineffective optimizations, and improve overall gameplay. Please do not use the results to justify power-level discrimination or any behavior that harms the community.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Professional Installer (Recommended) ⭐
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/caaatto/BlueMeter/releases)
2. Download `BlueMeterSetup.exe`
3. **Double-click `BlueMeterSetup.exe`**
4. Follow the setup wizard
5. .NET 8.0 will be automatically installed if needed
6. BlueMeter will launch automatically after installation

#### Option 2: Portable Build (For Developers)
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/caaatto/BlueMeter/releases)
2. Download `BlueMeter-vX.X.X-windows-x64.zip`
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. **Double-click `setup.bat`** (NOT the .exe!)
5. The setup script will:
   - Automatically install .NET 8.0 SDK (if needed)
   - Build BlueMeter
   - Ask if you want to launch now

⚠️ **Important**: Do NOT run `BlueMeter.WPF.exe` directly on first launch. Windows SmartScreen may incorrectly flag it as suspicious. Always use the installer or `setup.bat` → `launcher.bat` instead.

### Running BlueMeter
Once installed, simply **double-click `launcher.bat`** (portable) or use the Start Menu shortcut (installer) to start BlueMeter anytime.
